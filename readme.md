#Marelius Moen's Online CV
-----
This is the online CV for Marelius Moen and this project is made to increase my personal visibility online, to be a landingsite for potential employer, collaberators and collegues. It will serve as a more professional display compared to the personal Instagram and and Facebook accounts that is used to show what I do on my own time, both of these accounts have a link in the footer and they will continue to be used for private content about my everyday life with friends and family.

These are the initial plans and the design sketches for this site:
